# Build a draggable and resizable dashboard with Streamlit Elements

Streamlit Elements is a third-party component made by [okld](https://github.com/okld) that gives you the tools to compose beautiful applications and dashboards with Material UI widgets, Monaco editor (Visual Studio Code), Nivo charts, and more.

## How to use?

### Installation

The first step is to install Streamlit Elements in your environment:

```bash
pip install streamlit-elements==0.1.*
```

It is recommended to pin the version to `0.1.*`, as future versions might introduce breaking API changes.

### Usage

You can refer to [Streamlit Elements README](https://github.com/okld/streamlit-elements#getting-started) for an in-depth usage guide.

## What are we building?

The goal of today's challenge is to create a dashboard composed of three Material UI cards:

- A first card with a Monaco code editor to input some data ;
- A second card to display that data in a Nivo Bump chart ;
- A third card to show a YouTube video URL defined with a `st.text_input`.

You can use data generated from Nivo Bump demo there, in 'data' tab: https://nivo.rocks/bump/.

## Demo app

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/okld/streamlit-elements-demo/main)

## Code with line-by-line explanation

```python
# First, we will need the following imports for our application.

import json
import streamlit as st
from pathlib import Path

# As for Streamlit Elements, we will need all these objects.
# All available objects and there usage are listed there: https://github.com/okld/streamlit-elements#getting-started

from streamlit_elements import elements, dashboard, mui, editor, media, lazy, sync, nivo

# Change page layout to make the dashboard take the whole page.

st.set_page_config(layout="wide")

with st.sidebar:
    st.title("🗓️ #30DaysOfStreamlit")
    st.header("Day 27 - Streamlit Elements")
    st.write("Build a draggable and resizable dashboard with Streamlit Elements.")
    st.write("---")

    # Define URL for media player.
    media_url = st.text_input("Media URL", value="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIQQR_yq-8I")

# Initialize default data for code editor and chart.
#
# For this tutorial, we will need data for a Nivo Bump chart.
# You can get random data there, in tab 'data': https://nivo.rocks/bump/
#
# As you will see below, this session state item will be updated when our
# code editor change, and it will be read by Nivo Bump chart to draw the data.

if "data" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.data = Path("data.json").read_text()

# Define a default dashboard layout.
# Dashboard grid has 12 columns by default.
#
# For more information on available parameters:
# https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout#grid-item-props

layout = [
    # Editor item is positioned in coordinates x=0 and y=0, and takes 6/12 columns and has a height of 3.
    dashboard.Item("editor", 0, 0, 6, 3),
    # Chart item is positioned in coordinates x=6 and y=0, and takes 6/12 columns and has a height of 3.
    dashboard.Item("chart", 6, 0, 6, 3),
    # Media item is positioned in coordinates x=0 and y=3, and takes 6/12 columns and has a height of 4.
    dashboard.Item("media", 0, 2, 12, 4),
]

# Create a frame to display elements.

with elements("demo"):

    # Create a new dashboard with the layout specified above.
    #
    # draggableHandle is a CSS query selector to define the draggable part of each dashboard item.
    # Here, elements with a 'draggable' class name will be draggable.
    #
    # For more information on available parameters for dashboard grid:
    # https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout#grid-layout-props
    # https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout#responsive-grid-layout-props

    with dashboard.Grid(layout, draggableHandle=".draggable"):

        # First card, the code editor.
        #
        # We use the 'key' parameter to identify the correct dashboard item.
        #
        # To make card's content automatically fill the height available, we will use CSS flexbox.
        # sx is a parameter available with every Material UI widget to define CSS attributes.
        #
        # For more information regarding Card, flexbox and sx:
        # https://mui.com/components/cards/
        # https://mui.com/system/flexbox/
        # https://mui.com/system/the-sx-prop/

        with mui.Card(key="editor", sx={"display": "flex", "flexDirection": "column"}):

            # To make this header draggable, we just need to set its classname to 'draggable',
            # as defined above in dashboard.Grid's draggableHandle.

            mui.CardHeader(title="Editor", className="draggable")

            # We want to make card's content take all the height available by setting flex CSS value to 1.
            # We also want card's content to shrink when the card is shrinked by setting minHeight to 0.

            with mui.CardContent(sx={"flex": 1, "minHeight": 0}):

                # Here is our Monaco code editor.
                #
                # First, we set the default value to st.session_state.data that we initialized above.
                # Second, we define the language to use, JSON here.
                #
                # Then, we want to retrieve changes made to editor's content.
                # By checking Monaco documentation, there is an onChange property that takes a function.
                # This function is called everytime a change is made, and the updated content value is passed in
                # the first parameter (cf. onChange: https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react#props)
                #
                # Streamlit Elements provide a special sync() function. This function creates a callback that will
                # automatically forward its parameters to Streamlit's session state items.
                #
                # Examples
                # --------
                # Create a callback that forwards its first parameter to a session state item called "data":
                # >>> editor.Monaco(onChange=sync("data"))
                # >>> print(st.session_state.data)
                #
                # Create a callback that forwards its second parameter to a session state item called "ev":
                # >>> editor.Monaco(onChange=sync(None, "ev"))
                # >>> print(st.session_state.ev)
                #
                # Create a callback that forwards both of its parameters to session state:
                # >>> editor.Monaco(onChange=sync("data", "ev"))
                # >>> print(st.session_state.data)
                # >>> print(st.session_state.ev)
                #
                # Now, there is an issue: onChange is called everytime a change is made, which means everytime
                # you type a single character, your entire Streamlit app will rerun.
                #
                # To avoid this issue, you can tell Streamlit Elements to wait for another event to occur
                # (like a button click) to send the updated data, by wrapping your callback with lazy().
                #
                # For more information on available parameters for Monaco:
                # https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react

                editor.Monaco(
                    defaultValue=st.session_state.data,
                    language="json",
                    onChange=lazy(sync("data"))
                )

            with mui.CardActions:

                # Monaco editor has a lazy callback bound to onChange, which means that even if you change
                # Monaco's content, Streamlit won't be notified directly, thus won't reload everytime.
                # So we need another non-lazy event to trigger an update.
                #
                # The solution is to create a button that fires a callback on click.
                # Our callback doesn't need to do anything in particular. You can either create an empty
                # Python function, or use sync() with no argument.
                #
                # Now, everytime you will click that button, onClick callback will be fired, but every other
                # lazy callbacks that changed in the meantime will also be called.

                mui.Button("Apply changes", onClick=sync())

        # Second card, the Nivo Bump chart.
        # We will use the same flexbox configuration as the first card to auto adjust the content height.

            mui.CardHeader(title="Chart", className="draggable")

            # Like above, we want to make our content grow and shrink as the user resizes the card,
            # by setting flex to 1 and minHeight to 0.
